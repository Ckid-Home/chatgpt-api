description: Basic readonly Reddit API for getting top/hot/new/rising posts from subreddits.
---

- package: `@agentic/reddit`
- exports: `class RedditClient`, `namespace reddit`
- [source](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/agentic/blob/main/packages/reddit/src/reddit-client.ts)
- [reddit api docs](https://old.reddit.com/dev/api)

<Note>
  This client uses Reddit's free, publicly accessible legacy JSON API aimed at
  RSS feeds, so no API key or auth is required. With that being said, Reddit
  does impose rate limits on the API, so be considerate.
