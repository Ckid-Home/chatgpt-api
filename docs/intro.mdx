Agentic's standard library of TypeScript AI tools are **optimized for both TS-usage as well as LLM-based usage**, which is really important for testing and debugging.

Agentic tools work with any LLM capable of function calling and all of the major TS AI SDKs, including:

- Vercel AI SDK
- OpenAI
- LangChain
- LlamaIndex
- Mastra
- Firebase Genkit
- Dexa Dexter
- xsAI

## Features

- âœ… All tools are thoroughly tested in production
- âœ… Tools work across all leading TS AI SDKs
- âœ… Tools are hand-coded and extremely minimal
- âœ… Tools have both a good manual DX and LLM DX via the `@aiFunction` decorator
- âœ… Tools use native `fetch`
- âœ… Tools use [ky](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ky) to wrap `fetch`, so HTTP options, throttling, retries, etc are easy to customize
- âœ… Supports tools from any MCP server ([createMcpTools](/tools/mcp))
- âœ… Generate new Agentic tool clients from OpenAPI specs ([@agentic/openapi-to-ts](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/agentic/tree/main/packages/openapi-to-ts))
- âœ… 100% open source && not trying to sell you anything ðŸ’¯
